# Error Handling in Windows Dual Audio Manager

This document outlines the error handling strategies implemented in Windows Dual Audio Manager to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Core Error Handling Principles

1. **Fail Gracefully**: The application attempts to continue functioning even when errors occur
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors are logged to the console for troubleshooting
3. **User Feedback**: Critical errors are displayed to the user when appropriate
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Where possible, the system implements automatic recovery strategies

## Error Categories and Handling Strategies

### Audio Device Errors

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|
| Device Not Found | Log error, prevent operation, inform user |
| Device Access Denied | Log error, recommend running as administrator |
| Device Format Incompatible | Implement format conversion, fallback to compatible settings |
| Device Already In Use | Log conflict, attempt to share device |

### Buffer Management Errors

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|
| Buffer Underflow | Fill with silence, log warning, adjust buffer size |
| Buffer Overflow | Implement circular buffer, discard oldest data |
| Memory Allocation Failure | Reduce buffer size, recover gracefully |

### Threading and Concurrency Errors

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|
| Thread Termination | Clean up resources, log error |
| Deadlocks | Implement timeouts, use lock-free data structures |
| Task Cancellation | Handle cancellation tokens correctly |

### UI Errors

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|
| Control Not Found | Log error, prevent operation |
| Theme Application Failure | Fallback to default theme |
| Invalid User Input | Validate inputs, provide feedback |

## Exception Handling Policy

1. All public methods catch and handle exceptions
2. Low-level exceptions are wrapped in domain-specific exceptions
3. Critical exceptions trigger application-level error handling

## Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Audio Stream Recovery**: If audio stutters or cuts out, the system will:
   - Clear and reset buffers
   - Attempt to re-establish the audio stream
   - Implement progressive backoff for repeated failures

2. **Device Recovery**: If a device becomes unavailable:
   - Release all resources associated with the device
   - Notify the user
   - Allow reconnection when the device becomes available again

3. **Settings Recovery**: If settings become corrupted:
   - Fall back to default settings
   - Attempt to recover valid settings

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

When encountering errors:

1. Check the console logs for detailed error information
2. Verify that audio devices are properly connected and enabled
3. Try running the application with administrator privileges
4. Restart the application if it encounters persistent issues

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any errors that the application doesn't handle gracefully, please report them on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MaheshSharan/WindowsDualAudioManager/issues) with the following information:

1. Detailed description of what you were doing when the error occurred
2. Any error messages displayed
3. Steps to reproduce the issue
4. Your Windows version and audio device information
